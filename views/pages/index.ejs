          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p class="align-left">
            HackSoc is the University of Manchester's tech society. We are a big community of people with a passion for
            technology and creating innovative solutions for everyone to enjoy. Through our hackathons and other
            events, we aim to bring students and industry closer together. When we aren’t organising our own events we
            also travel to events in places like Barcelona, Helsinki, and Bordeaux, amongst other exotic destinations,
            often for free thanks to our sponsors. Come join us to see what we get up to this year!
          </p>
          <p class="align-left">
            Our own events are suited to every level of knowledge and all degree courses. If you are someone who is
            interested in knowing how they can use computers to see an idea come to life, HackSoc is the society for
            you. It doesn’t matter if you are a first year humanities student, an experienced developer, or just
            starting to explore programming, you will never be bored at our events. And if you still aren’t convinced,
            we have free pizza (and occasionally drinks).
